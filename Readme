# RISC-V Simulator (C++)

This project is a **fully implemented RISC-V simulator** written in C++.  
It supports the execution of RISC-V assembly programs with features for instruction parsing, memory management, and register updates.

## Features
- Supports R/I/S/B/U/J instruction formats
- Handles branching, load/store operations, and ALU instructions
- Memory management and register file simulation
- Debugging utilities:
  - Breakpoints
  - Step-by-step execution
  - Memory/register inspection


By default, all the values are considered to be in decimal including the case of .dword as well
But except for once case, wherein we use the command "mem" 
where it accepts the base address in hexadecimal format starting with 0x.
